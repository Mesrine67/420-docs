### Can I use my own multicharacter?

Yes, you can. To papi_management the built in multicharacter change this setting to true in `papi_management/config/client.lua`
```lua filename="papi_management/config/client.lua"
 -- Whether you have an external character management resource. (If true, disables the character management inside the core)
useExternalCharacters = false,
```
:::info[Stuck in loading screen?]
Your multicharacter most likely never calls the loading screen to shutdown. You can fix this 2 ways:
1. Open your `server.cfg` and edit `setr loadscreen:externalShutdown` to be `false`
2. Edit your multicharacter resources to call the `ShutdownLoadingScreen()` and `ShutdownLoadingScreenNui()` natives. Like papi_management does [here](https://github.com/Mesrine67/papi_management/blob/6e50abaf966295a4245c901a37ecb64343d63677/client/character.lua#L387-L388)
