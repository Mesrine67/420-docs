```lua
exports.papi_management:SetGang(identifier, gangName, grade)
```

- identifier: `source | citizenid`
- gangName: `string`
- grade: `integer`

## SetPlayerPrimaryGang

Sets the given player's primary gang to the given gang, only if they already have it.

```lua
exports.papi_management:SetPlayerPrimaryGang(citizenid, gangName)
```

- citizenid: `string`
- gangName: `string`

## AddPlayerToGang

Adds the given player to the given gang, or overwrites their grade if they're already in that gang.

```lua
exports.papi_management:AddPlayerToGang(citizenid, gangName, grade)
```

- citizenid: `string`
- gangName: `string`
- grade: `integer`

## RemovePlayerFromGang

Removes the given player from the given gang.
Also updates the given player's primary gang to no gang if the given gang is the player's primary.

```lua
exports.papi_management:RemovePlayerFromGang(citizenid, gangName)
```

- citizenid: `string`
- gangName: `string`

## HasPrimaryGroup

Checks if the given player's current Job/Gang or citizenid matches against a single group, array of group, or group/grade or list of citizenids. Does not check if player is on or off duty

```lua
exports.papi_management:HasPrimaryGroup(source, filter)
```

- source: `integer`
- filter: `string` or `string[]` or `table<string, number>`
  - A group/citizenid, array of groups/citizenids, or pairs of groups-grades required to pass the check.

Returns:

- success: `boolean`

## HasGroup

Checks if the given player's list of groups (Jobs/Gangs) or citizenid matches against a single group, array of group, or group/grade or list of citizenids. Does not check if player is on or off duty for any particular filter

```lua
exports.papi_management:HasGroup(source, filter)
```
- source: `integer`
- filter: `string` or `string[]` or `table<string, number>`
  - A group/citizenid, array of groups/citizenids, or pairs of groups-grades required to pass the check.

Returns:

- success: `boolean`

## GetGroups

Returns a combined table of all the groups a given player currently has.

```lua
exports.papi_management:GetGroups(source)
```

- source: `integer`

Returns:

- `table<string, number>`

## IsGradeBoss

Returns boolean on if a given group/grade combination is a boss grade. Currently this is based on the presence of a `isboss` boolean being true in the grade definition

```lua
exports.papi_management:IsGradeBoss(group, grade)
```

- group: `string`
- grade: `integer`

Returns:

- success: `boolean`

## GetGroupMembers

Returns a table of all citizenids and associated grade for a given group and type

```lua
exports.papi_management:GetGroupMembers(group, type)
```

- group: `string`
- type: `job | gang`

Returns:

- `table<citizenid, number>`

## DeleteVehicle

Deletes the vehicle entity from the game world. Preferred over the native DeleteEntity function as DeleteVehicle will remove persistence from the vehicle to allow it to be deleted.

```lua
exports.papi_management:DeleteVehicle(entity)
```

- entity: `number`

## EnablePersistence

Marks a vehicle to be persisted, which will respawn the vehicle with the same properties if it is deleted by the server. Idempotent.

```lua
exports.papi_management:EnablePersistence(entity)
```

- entity: `number`

## DisablePersistence

Removes the persistence attribute from a vehicle, allowing it to be deleted without being respawned. Idempotent. No-op if the vehicle is not already persisted.

```lua
exports.papi_management:DisablePersistence(entity)
```

- entity: `number`

## GetVehicleClass

Equivalent to [GetVehicleClass](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x29439776AAA00A62) client native, but for the server. Works by asking a random client for all the vehicle models and their classes, then caching this while the server is online.
Due to this, may not work if there is no client on to query.

```lua
exports.papi_management:GetVehicleClass(hash)
```

- hash: `number`

## SearchPlayers

Searches both online and offline players on a set of filters and returns players which match all filtered values.

Filters:
- license?: license string. i.e. 'license2:xxx'
- job?: name of the job
- gang?: name of the gang
- metadata?: `table<string, number|string|boolean>`
  - strict?: `boolean` if true, metadata number values match on exact equivalence, else numbers match if value is greater than or equal to filter.

```lua
exports.papi_management:SearchPlayers(filters)
```

- filters: `table<string, any>`

Returns:

- [`Player[]`](../types/player.mdx#player)

### Example Usage
Searching for the value of a nested metadata key
```lua
local licensedDrivers = exports.papi_management:SearchPlayers({
  metadata = {
    ['licences.driver'] = true
  }
})
```

## CreateSessionId

Sets the sessionId statebag on an entity to a unique number.
SessionIds are useful in cases where an entity could be deleted and recreated but needs a stable identifier such as vehicle persistence.

```lua
exports.papi_management:CreateSessionId(entity)
```

- entity: `integer`

Returns:

- sessionId: `integer`
